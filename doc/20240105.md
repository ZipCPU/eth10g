## Today's task: Performance measurements.

Using iPerf3, version 3.1.3:

1. [Performance via TCP/IPv4](20240105-iperf-1.pdf)

   This seems to only point out that the PC's on both end aren't tuned for this
   kind of high speed.

2. [Early performance via UDP/IPv4](20240105-iperf-2.pdf)

3. [Second performance test via UDP/IPv4](20240105-iperf-3.pdf)

4. Noticing that one link achieved 3.6Gb/s, and the other 1.4Gb/s, I remembered
   that the ZipCPU was sending ARP requests.  All requests were also forwarded
   to the ZipCPU.
 
   After shutting down the ZipCPU, link speed dropped to zero.  Why?  Because
   the CPU's buffer had filled up, and the CPU wasn't draining it.  Fixing this
   required both shutting down automatic port forwarding to the ZipCPU as well
   as placing the virtual FIFO for the ZipCPU into it's reset state.

   After that ...

5. [Final performance test, using UDP/IPv4, no CPU port](20240105-iperf-4c.pdf).

   I also grabbed a screen capture from the [iPerf server side
   output](20240105-iperf-4s.pdf).
